This project contains my code for Correlation Power Analysis (CPA) using  ciphertext data. You can run this code using your own ciphertext data. In addition to CPA code, 
there is also GPU implementation for correlation analysis, which can be used to speed up the statistical analysis part. This is a simple version of our work. In the next version,
we will include an improved GPU-based correlation coefficient to project.

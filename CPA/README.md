These files contain my codes for correlation power analysis attack on cipher text data.
 Moreover, I provided my normal correlation coefficient CUDA code, which utilises shared memory, and has 100% occupency.
 Unfortunately, I cannot provided you with my latest version until I publish it as a paper. 
You can run this code using your own ciphertext and power traces.
